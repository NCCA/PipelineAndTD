# Week 2 The structure of a DCC

- Most DCC tools are data filters
- Most data is the same (float values with index), knowing this we can dig in and figure out what is wrong or what we need to do.

- Software lifecycle for DCC and Pipelines
    - Install, develop, test , deploy (repeat / maintain)
- Devops for Pipeline , docker, pyenv , virtualenv
- TDD, Documentation (how, where)
